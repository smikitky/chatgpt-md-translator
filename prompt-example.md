I am translating the documentation for %%%%%.
Translate the Markdown content I'll paste later into %%%%%.

You must strictly follow the rules below.

- Never change the Markdown markup structure. Don't add or remove links. Do not change any URL.
- Never change the contents of code blocks even if they appear to have a bug.
- Always preserve the original line breaks. Do not add or remove blank lines.
- Never touch the permalink such as `{/*examples*/}` at the end of each heading.
- Never touch HTML-like tags such as `<Notes>`.
